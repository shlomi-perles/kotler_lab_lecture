<h1 align="center">Kotler's Lab Lecture</h1>

## ℹ️ About

This [lecture](https://shlomi-perles.github.io/kotler_lab_lecture/)  was given as part of a research project in
<a href="https://shlomikotler.huji.ac.il/"> Shlomi Kotler's lab</a>.<br>
Here, we have presented the theory behind the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf2998">experimental system</a>
used in the lab and the simulation we conducted, using COMSOL, in order to estimate important constants characterizing the system.


## ❓ How

The animations were made by the great [3b1b](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) package - [manim community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).
To make slides out of the videos, we've also used the [manim-editor](https://docs.editor.manim.community/en/stable/) plugin.
